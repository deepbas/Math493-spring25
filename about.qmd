# Course overview

Welcome to Advanced Topics in Statistics: Applied Time Series! This course focuses on analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data through modern statistical methods. Using real-world case studies and hands-on projects, you will learn to build, evaluate, and compare models like ARIMA and ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) to solve problems in economics, finance, public health, and beyond.

We will emphasize practical skills, including exploratory time series analysis, model diagnostics, and state-space frameworks, using R for computation and visualization. By the end of the course, you will be able to interpret complex time series patterns, generate reliable forecasts, and communicate insights effectively to diverse audiences.



## Learning Objectives

<blockquote>

- Learn basic analysis of time series data and exploratory data analysis.
- Understand and apply time series regression models.
- Master autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models.
- Master ARIMA, ETS, and state-space models for forecasting.
- Compare and select models (e.g., ETS vs ARIMA) using diagnostic tools.
- Utilize R for computation, visualization, and analysis of time series data.
- Develop skills to interpret and communicate time series results effectively.
