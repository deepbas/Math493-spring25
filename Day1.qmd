## Class Pipelines

<br>

::: bql
- Most of the course information and schedule will be posted in [MyClasses](https://salisbury.instructure.com/courses/67043)
- Homework will be posted but not collected
- Labs most Tuesdays; lab reports due in [MyClasses](https://salisbury.instructure.com/courses/67043) a week from the lab date
- Quizzes every Friday in-person; includes HW, lectures, labs

# Statistics 

Statistics is the study of data and the uncertainties surrounding them. We will take a more conceptual route to statistics in this course.
:::

::: centered-content
### What and Why of Statistics?

::: lqt
Science of collecting, describing, analyzing, and making decisions based on data:
- Sampling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Inference
:::

::: green-h
Allows us to make informed decisions in the face of uncertainty and lets us take an unbiased, evidence-based viewpoint.
:::
:::

## Statistical Computation

<br>
<br>

::: bq
- Statistical computing software called R
- RStudio/Posit provides a user-friendly interface to R
- R Markdown is a platform in Posit to write your codes and results

## Data: Units and Variables

::: bqt
**Experimental (or Observational) Unit**

An experimental (or observational) unit is an object (e.g., person, thing, transaction, or event) about which we collect data.
:::

::: cle6
Data is stored and presented in a dataset that comprises variables measured on units.

- A **variable** is any characteristic that is recorded for each unit.
:::
:::

::: centered-content
### `Gpa_IQ` Dataset 

::: scrollable
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(openintro)
knitr::kable(head(gpa_iq), format = "html")
```
:::

Each row = unit & Each column = variable.
:::

::: centered-content
## Qualitative Versus Quantitative

> Variables are classified as either **qualitative** or **quantitative:**

::: cle2
- A **qualitative variable** divides the cases into groups (e.g., gender, country, state).
- A **quantitative variable** measures a numerical quantity for each case (e.g., age, height, sleep hours, blood pressure).

## Kidney Cancer

> Counties with the highest kidney cancer rates.

:::

::: centered-content
## Kidney Cancer

> If the cases in the kidney cancer dataset are people, then the measured variable is qualitative.

::: green-h
We categorize each person as either having kidney cancer or not, which is qualitative.
:::
:::

::: centered-content
## Kidney Cancer

> If the cases in the kidney cancer dataset are counties, then the measured variable is quantitative.

::: green-h
Data collected at the county level is aggregated across all people living in the county. We then get rates of cancer, which are numbers (quantitative).
:::
:::

::: centered-content
## Variable Manipulations

::: bq
Can use numbers to code categories of qualitative variables.

- e.g., Gender (1 for male and 2 for female).
:::

<br>

::: bq
Can convert quantitative variables into qualitative groups.

- e.g., Income (0-50000 as Low, 50000+ as High).
