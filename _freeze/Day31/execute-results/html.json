For example, the Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR) at the University of Florida conducts quarterly surveys to gauge consumer sentiment in the Sunshine State. Suppose that BEBR randomly samples 484 consumers and finds that only 157 are optimistic about the state of the economy. Use a $90 \\%$ confidence interval to estimate the proportion of all consumers in Florida who are optimistic about the state of the economy. Based on the confidence interval, can BEBR infer that a minority of Florida consumers is optimistic about the economy?\n\n##\n\n\n\n\n## {.font60}\n\n> Example 2: The reputations (and hence sales) of many businesses can be severely damaged by shipments of manufactured items that contain a large percentage of defectives. For example, a manufacturer of alkaline batteries may want to be reasonably certain that less than $5 \\%$ of its batteries are defective. Suppose 300 batteries are randomly selected from a very large shipment; each is tested and 10 defective batteries are found. Does this outcome provide sufficient evidence for the manufacturer to conclude that the fraction.\n\n\n\n##\n\n\n## {.font50}\n\n> Example 3: A cellular telephone manufacturer that entered the post-regulation market quickly has an initial problem with excessive customer complaints and consequent returns of cell phones for repair or replacement. The manufacturer wants to estimate the magnitude of the problem in order to design a quality control program. How many cellular telephones should be sampled and checked in order to estimate the fraction defective, p, to within .01 with $90 \\%$ confidence?\n\n\n",
