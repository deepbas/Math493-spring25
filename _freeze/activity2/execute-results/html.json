Three fundamental statistical concepts that help capture these relationships are **covariance**, **correlation**, and **partial correlation**.\n\n### Covariance\n\nCovariance measures how two variables move together. For two time series $X_t$ and $Y_t$, the sample covariance over $n$ periods is given by:\n\n$$\n\\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{t=1}^{n} (X_t - \\bar{X})(Y_t - \\bar{Y})\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$ are the sample means. A positive covariance indicates that when $X_t$ is above its mean, $Y_t$ tends to be above its mean as well, and vice versa.\n\n### Correlation\n\nCorrelation standardizes covariance, providing a dimensionless measure between -1 and 1:\n\n$$\n\\rho_{XY} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}(X, Y)}{\\sigma_X \\sigma_Y}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma_X$ and $\\sigma_Y$ are the standard deviations of $X_t$ and $Y_t$. A correlation of 1 means perfect positive linear relationship, -1 means perfect negative linear relationship, and 0 suggests no linear relationship.\n\n### Partial Correlation\n\nPartial correlation measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the effect of one or more additional variables. For three variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, the partial correlation between $X$ and $Y$ controlling for $Z$ is defined as:\n\n$$\n\\rho_{XY \\cdot Z} = \\frac{\\rho_{XY} - \\rho_{XZ}\\rho_{YZ}}{\\sqrt{(1-\\rho_{XZ}^2)(1-\\rho_{YZ}^2)}}\n$$\n\nThis formula removes the influence of $Z$ on both $X$ and $Y$, providing a clearer picture of their direct relationship.\n\n\n\n## Applied Example Using `fpp3` Data\n\nConsider the `global_economy` dataset from the `fpp3` package, which contains economic indicators for various countries over time. We can explore relationships such as:\n\n- Covariance and correlation between Growth and CPI for different countries.\n- Partial correlation to understand the relationship between Imports and Exports while controlling for GDP.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Filter data for Australia and select relevant variables\naus_data <- global_economy %>%\n  filter(Country == \"Australia\") %>%    # <1>\n  select(Year, GDP, Growth, Population, CPI, Imports, Exports) # <2>\n```\n:::\n\n1. Filter the `global_economy` dataset to include only rows where the country is Australia.\n2. Select the variables of interest: Year, Growth, Population, and CPI\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Calculate covariance between GDP and Population for Australia\ncov_gdp_pop <- cov(aus_data$Growth, aus_data$CPI, use = \"complete.obs\")  # <1>\ncov_gdp_pop  \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] -17.36472\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n1.
