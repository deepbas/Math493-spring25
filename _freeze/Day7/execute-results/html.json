This rule uses conditional probabilities:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)\n  $$\n  \n  Alternatively:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A \\cap B) = P(B) \\cdot P(A|B)\n  $$\n\n- **Interpretation**: The rule helps us understand how the occurrence of one event influences the probability of another.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Law of Total Probability\n\n::: cle8\n::: font70\n\n- The **law of total probability** allows us to calculate the probability of an event by considering all possible scenarios. For two mutually exclusive and exhaustive events $B$ and $B^c$:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A) = P(B) \\cdot P(A|B) + P(B^c) \\cdot P(A|B^c)\n  $$\n\n- **Application**: This is particularly useful when dealing with partitioned sample spaces.\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##  \n\n::: font60\n> Example 1: Suppose that two balls are to be selected at random, without replacement, from a box containing $r$ red balls and $b$ blue balls. What is the probability that the first ball will be red and the second ball will be blue? What is the probability that the second ball will be blue?\n:::\n\n\n## Independence in Probability\n\n::: cle9\n::: font70\n- Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A|B) = P(A) \\quad \\text{and} \\quad P(B|A) = P(B)\n  $$\n\n- **Intersection Rule for Independent Events**:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)\n  $$\n\n- **Key Insight**: Independence cannot be inferred from Venn diagrams; it must be verified through probability calculations.\n\n:::\n:::\n## \n\n::: font60\n> Example 2 Consider the experiment of tossing a fair die, and let\n$$A= \\{\\text{Observe an even number.}\\}$$\n$$B= \\{\\text{Observe a number less than or equal to 4.}\\}$$\nAre $A$ and $B$ independent events?\n:::\n\n\n##\n\n::: font70\n\n> Example 3: The American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT) found that $25 \\%$ of divorced couples are classified as \"fiery foes\" (i.e., they communicate through their children and are hostile toward each other).\n\na. What is the probability that in a sample of 2 divorced couples, both are classified as \"fiery foes\"?\n\n<br>\n\nb. What is the probability that in a sample of 10 divorced couples, all 10 are classified as \"fiery foes\"?\n\n:::\n\n## Bayes's Rule and Its Foundation\n\n::: cle12\n::: font50\n\n- Recall the **multiplicative rule**:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B|A) = P(B) \\cdot P(A|B)\n  $$\n  \n- Rearranging gives **Bayes's Rule**:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)}{P(B)}\n  $$\n  \n- Incorporating the **law of total probability**:\n  \n  $$\n  P(A|B) = \\frac{P(A) \\cdot P(B|A)}{P(A) \\cdot P(B|A) + P(A^c) \\cdot P(B|A^c)}\n  $$\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Bayes Rule Example\n\n::: ws\n::: font70\n\n- **Scenario**: Estimating the likelihood of liver disease in a patient who is an alcoholic.\n- **Define Events**:\n  - $A$: Patient has liver disease.\n  - $B$: Patient is an alcoholic.\n- **Probabilities**:\n  - $P(A) = 0.10$ (10% of patients have liver disease)\n  - $P(B) = 0.05$ (5% of patients are alcoholics)\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Application of Bayes's Rule\n\n::: fsp\n::: font70\n\n- **Given**: You need to find $P(A | B)$, the probability of liver disease if the patient is an alcoholic.\n- **Available Data**: $P(B | A) = 0.07$ (7% of those with liver disease are alcoholics)\n- **Bayes's Rule Calculation**:\n  \n  $$P(A | B) = P(A) \\cdot \\frac{P(B | A)}{P(B)} = 0.10 \\cdot \\frac{0.07}{0.05} = 0.14$$\n\n- **Interpretation**: A patient who is an alcoholic has a 14% chance of having liver disease, higher than the general clinic population.\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n##\n\n::: font50\n\n> Example 4: (Test for a Disease) Consider a certain disease that the chance of a randomly selected individual having this disease is $r_1$ (this can be estimated from the historical data). Suppose there is a medical test for this disease. If a person has the disease, there is a probability of $r_2$ that the test will give a positive response. If a person does not have the disease, there is a probability of $r_3$ that the test will give a positive response. Suppose you take the test. What is the probability that you get a positive response but in fact, you do not have the disease? Derive the formula, then compute the results for the following sets of values of paameters.\n\n1. $r_1=0.0001, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$\n2. $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$\n3. $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.9999, r_3=0.0001$\n\n:::\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n\n\n## \n\n::: font50\n\n> Example 5: (Test for a Disease 2) Consider the previous example with $r_1=0.01, r_2=0.99, r_3=0.01$ If you take the test and get a positive response. You believe the result is not accurate, and test again and still get a positive response, what is the probability that in fact you do not have the disease?\n\n:::\n\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n::: cle6\n::: font80\n1. **Multiplicative Rule**: Helps calculate joint probabilities using conditional probabilities.\n2. **Law of Total Probability**: Useful for partitioning sample spaces.\n3. **Independence**: Events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the other.\n4. **Bayes's Rule**: Updates probabilities based on new information.\n:::\n:::\n",
