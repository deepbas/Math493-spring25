This session introduces the student's t-statistic, a better-suited approach for such scenarios.\n:::\n\n## Challenges with Small Samples {.font70}\n\n::: cle13\n- **Normality Assumption**: For samples smaller than 30, the distribution of the population must be approximately normal for the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ to be considered normally distributed. For example, if you're studying the heights of a rare species of plant, and can only find a few samples, the underlying distribution of these heights must be normal for standard approaches to work.\n- **Standard Deviation Issues**: When using the sample standard deviation $s$ in place of the population standard deviation $\\sigma$, the estimate becomes less reliable with smaller samples. Consider a scenario where you measure the amount of a chemical in water samples from different locations. With only a few samples, the variability in your measurements could significantly affect the reliability of your estimates, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.\n:::\n\n## Introducing the Student's t-Statistic {.font80}\n\n::: cle14\nGiven the issues identified with small samples, the Student's t-statistic offers a refined method for estimating population parameters:\n$$\nT = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{s / \\sqrt{n}}\n$$\nThis formula adjusts for the additional uncertainty inherent in small samples.\n:::\n\n## Comparison with the z-Statistic {.font80}\n\n::: cle10\nThe t-statistic is analogous to the z-statistic used for larger samples, where the population standard deviation $\\sigma$ is known or the sample is large enough ($n \\geq 30$) for reliable approximation:\n$$\nZ = \\frac{\\bar{x} - \\mu}{\\sigma / \\sqrt{n}}\n$$\n:::\n\n## Why Use the t-Distribution? {.font80}\n\n::: cle11\n- **Degrees of Freedom**: The shape of the t-distribution and its variability depend on the degrees of freedom (df = $n-1$), which adjusts as the sample size changes. This flexibility makes it particularly useful for small sample sizes.\n:::\n\n##\n\n<img src=\"images/Day20-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"80%\"  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n\n##\n\n<img src=\"images/Day20-2.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"80%\"  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n\n\n##\n\n<img src=\"images/Day20-3.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"80%\"  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n\n\n<img src=\"images/Day20-4.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"80%\"  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n\n\n\n\n## {.font60}\n\n\n> Example 1: Consider the pharmaceutical company that desires an estimateof the mean increase in blood pressure of patients who take a new drug. The blood pressure increases (measured in points) for the n $=6$ patients in the human testing phase are shown in the following. Use this information to construct a $95 \\%$ confidence interval for $\\mu$, the mean increase in blood pressure associated with the new drug for all patients in the population.\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\begin{array}{llllll}\n1.7 & 3.0 & 0.8 & 3.4 & 2.7 & 2.1\n\\end{array}\n\\end{align*}\n\n(From R/hand calculation, $\\bar{x}=2.283, s=0.950$ )\n\n\n##\n\n\n\n\n## {.font60}\n\n> Example 2: Some quality control experiments require destructive sampling (i.e., the test to determine whether the item is defective destroys the item) in order to measure a particular characteristic of the product. The cost of destructive sampling often dictates small samples. Suppose a manufacturer of printers for personal computers wishes to estimate the mean number of characters printed before the printhead fails. The printer manufacturer tests $n=15$ printheads and records the number of characters printed until failure for each. These 15 measurements (in millions of characters) are listed in the following table.\n\n<img src=\"images/Day20-5.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" width=\"80%\"  loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n\n(From R/hand calculation, $\\bar{x}=1.23867, s=0.19316$ )\n\na. Form a $99 \\%$ confidence interval for the mean number of characters printed before the printhead fails. Interpret the result.\n\n## {.font60}\n\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n\nb. What assumption is required for the interval you found in part a to be valid? Is that assumption reasonably satisfied?\n\n\n\n##\n",
