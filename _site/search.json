    "text": "Welcome to Advanced Topics in Statistics: Applied Time Series! This course focuses on analyzing and forecasting time-dependent data through modern statistical methods. Using real-world case studies and hands-on projects, you will learn to build, evaluate, and compare models like ARIMA and ETS (Error-Trend-Seasonality) to solve problems in economics, finance, public health, and beyond.\nWe will emphasize practical skills, including exploratory time series analysis, model diagnostics, and state-space frameworks, using R for computation and visualization. By the end of the course, you will be able to interpret complex time series patterns, generate reliable forecasts, and communicate insights effectively to diverse audiences.\n\n\n\n\nLearn basic analysis of time series data and exploratory data analysis.\nUnderstand and apply time series regression models.\nMaster autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models.\nMaster ARIMA, ETS, and state-space models for forecasting.\nCompare and select models (e.g., ETS vs ARIMA) using diagnostic tools.\nUtilize R for computation, visualization, and analysis of time series data.\nDevelop skills to interpret and communicate time series results effectively."

This can be done in several ways:\n\n\nUsing RStudio:\n\nIn RStudio, you can set the working directory through the menu by navigating to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Choose Directory... and selecting your math493 folder.\n\n\n\nUsing R Script:\n\nYou can also set the working directory directly in an R script using the setwd() function. Place the following line of code at the beginning of your script:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math493\")\nReplace \"~/math493\" with the actual path to your course folder.\n\n\nUsing R Console:\n\nYou can manually set the working directory in the R console with the same command:\n\nsetwd(\"~/math493\")"
